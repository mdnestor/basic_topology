the space X is hausdorff if for every x ≠ y
there exist disjoint neighborhoods U of x and V of y

Every metric space is hausdorff
let x ≠ y

um .. i mean pick some distance and neighborhood is any point within that dist

idk :3
i guess you can have radius = dist(x, y) / 2 ?

Suppose by contradiction exists x, f(x) ≠ g(x)

oh then is like um disjoint neighborhoods

so I get open nbhds U of f(x) and V of g(x) which are disjoint

but by density exist z1 in U ∩ D such that f(z1) = g(z1)
